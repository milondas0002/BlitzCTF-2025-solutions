CHAPTER
ONE
THE
WORST
BIRTHDAY
Not
for
the
first
time,
an
argument
had
broken
out
over
breakfast
at
number
four,
Privet
Drive.
Mr.
Vernon
Dursley
had
been
woken
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
by
a
loud,
hooting
noise
from
his
nephew
Harry’s
room.
“Third
time
this
week!”
he
roared
across
the
table.
“If
you
can’t
control
that
owl,
it’ll
have
to
go!”
Harry
tried,
yet
again,
to
explain.
“She’s
bored,”
he
said.
“She’s
used
to
flying
around
outside.
If
I
could
just
let
her
out
at
night
—”
“Do
I
look
stupid?”
snarled
Uncle
Vernon,
a
bit
of
fried
egg
dangling
from
his
bushy
mustache.
“I
know
what’ll
happen
if
that
owl’s
let
out.”
He
exchanged
dark
looks
with
his
wife,
Petunia.
Harry
tried
to
argue
back
but
his
words
were
drowned
by
a
long,
loud
belch
from
the
Dursleys’
son,
Dudley.
