Solution:
I wasn't been able to solve the challenge during contest time. Here is link for official writeup "https://ctf-8.gitbook.io/vedved/blitz-ctf-2025-official-writeups" if ypu want to learn actually how it should be solved
But it can also be solve using only strings command
But there is a catch, the catch is that u just simply have to guess that the flag is encoded in base64 which is very common in CTF scenarios
just use this command, "strings firefoxchall | grep -i "QmxpdHp"" and you will get your flag in base64 format, which stand for Blitz
So the command will show ypu this output,
"totallynormalcookie=QmxpdHp7ZjFyM2YweF81aDB1bGRfM25jcnlwdF9jMDBrMTM1fQo%3D; Max-Age=86400; Path=/; Expires=Sat, 22 Mar 2025 17:38:46 GMT; HttpOnly

After decoding it using cyberchef you will find the flag, "Blitz{f1r3f0x_5h0uld_3ncrypt_c00k135}"
